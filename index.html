    <h1>Fatima's Introduction:</h1>

    <h3><u>A little about myself:</u></h3>

    <p>My name is Fatima Ali. I live in Landskrona, Sweden.
        I came to Sweden four months ago in September. I live
        here with my family. I have previously studied Computer
        Sciences and computer arts(graphic design). Now I am 
        studying programming with Michelle at Sundsgarden adult
        highschool.
    </p>

    <h3><u>My interests:</u></h3>

    <p>I am an artist. I love painting with oil paints. I have
        been interested in arts and crafts since childhood. But 
        I was more interested in computer technology. So, that 
        is why I choosed it as a career path and it is a much
        better option than arts. But, I still make a lot of 
        artworks.
    </p>

   <h3><u>Goals:</u></h3> 

   <p>My goal with this education is to be able to progress in 
       the profession of IT. i also want to continue my university
       education in the same field. Which requires prior knowledge
       of programming.
